# The Lima Telemetry Project

## About the project

The Lima Telemetry project is a solution to gathering telemetry data from your customers/clients.

This project is currently in open-beta and will be getting fast updates.

## Supported OS

Currently, only Windows, Linux, and macOS executables are published. If you would like another OS possibly supported, please open an issue!

## How to use

1: Download the latest executable for your operating system from the repository's Release tab.

2: Execute the executable on a server or your own desktop to start the server.

_If you are running this on a server, make sure to port forward it_

3: Send data to the server using the parameters of os,arch,totalmem or use [lima-client]{https://www.npmjs.com/package/lima-client}

_Server operates on port 2525_

## Client Libraries

An official lima Javascript library is in development and will be released soon1

## Notices

Currently the software is in early beta / proof of concept

If you are to use this, there is no authentication aka everyone and anyone can send data to your Lima server

I plan to add authentication and a sort of dashboard for managing and gathering data
